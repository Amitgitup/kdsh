Analysis:
The evidence shows the father (Noirtier) survived the revolutionary period, having been hunted as a Girondin, directly contradicting the claim that he was guillotined. Additionally, the son (Villefort) is portrayed as a staunch royalist, contradicting the claim that the trauma caused a revulsion for the old regime.

The backstory contradicts the narrative evidence."
